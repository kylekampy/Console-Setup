# Console Setup

This repository contains the setup for each development environment I have, whether it is macOS, Linux, or Windows.  Each folder has its own setup and dotfiles that I use as part of my daily development.

## Colors

Across all machines, I tend to like the same colors for my text editor of choice as well as console. [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) is a sixteen color palette (eight monotones, eight accent colors) designed for use with console and GUI applications.  This color scheme is available for most IDEs and console applications.

## Fonts

When dealing with the console, I like like rich interactions such as ones provided by [Powerline](https://github.com/powerline/powerline).  Regardless of the system, I install the patched fonts:
- [Powerline Patched Fonts](https://github.com/powerline/fonts)
- [Menlo for Powerline](https://github.com/abertsch/Menlo-for-Powerline)


## Visual Studio Code Configuration

I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) pretty much for everything nowadays. It has support for pretty much every programming language and platform.  These are the extensions that I use per category.  For my color theme, I use `Solarized Dark`, and for fonts, I use `Fira Code for Powerline` for both the text editor and the console.  And if you're like me, and like living on the edge, try [Visual Studio Code Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/) for daily updates!
